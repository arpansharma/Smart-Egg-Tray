# Smart-Egg-Tray

## Raspberry Pi used for connectivity and sensor integration.

It's basically a modified "Tray of Eggs" (such as those used for ice cubes in households) that notifies the user when he goes out of stock by means of an SMS, E-mail and a Tweet. It also places an order for you to your preferred vendor and you get your eggs delivered at your door steps.
